# Bamazon

*What does it do?*<br>
Bamazon is a Command Line Interface (CLI) Node application that provides retail storefront functionality for customers, managers, and supervisors. It's core features include: viewing items and checkout for customers, viewing stock levels and adding new products to database for managers, and viewing Profit & Loss metrics as well as creating new departments for supervisors.

*Why is this useful?*<br>
Bamazon is a one stop shop retail app run from the command line without the need to navigate to and open several other applications. It contains built in permissions so each role only has access to the commands granted by pay grade or title.

*How can I get started?* <br>
Just start typing! The commands below initiate the app with separate permissions:<br><br>
**node bamazonCustomer**<br>
**node bamazonManager**<br>
**node bamazonSupervisor**

*What technologies are used?*<br>
node.js<br>
mySQL
